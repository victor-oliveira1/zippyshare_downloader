***I've changed the name too (It's more stylish :D)***

**ZippyDown** is a Python3 script to download files from website: **"http://zippyshare.com"** directly from your terminal, without the need for web browsers.

**NOTE:** Zippyshare is changing the download algorithm regularly, and because of this, i'm using PhantomJS + selenium.  
  
## Installing:  
You need to download Chromedriver and put in the PATH environment:  
http://chromedriver.chromium.org/
  
And you need selenium module for Python 3:  
[Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)  

## TODO LIST:  
* Batch processing mode;
* CTRL+C traps (Cleans tmp file);
* Working with exceptions;  
* URL validation.
